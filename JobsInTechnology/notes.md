# Careers in the Technology Sector

## Requirements: 

A presentation for a group of Grade 8 students, discussing careers in the Technology Sector.

1) What does your job involve/what does a typical day look like.

2) What programs/subjects/level of education do you need to get a job in this field?

3) What are the job opportunities like in your field?

4) How would someone in this field view and sort through potential applicants?


Specific information about your organization. What does it do? What are the offices like? How is it working with other people in the technology sector?

Benefits and possible drawbacks/hurdles as well.




## Story Arc:

- brief introduction of me.
- brief introduction of communitech and apps factory
- What does it do? What are the offices like? How is it working with other people in the technology sector?
- typical day for me and the team
- viewing and sorting resumes

broaden, start talking more about technology industry
- technology is not just software development. other deeply important roles that are technical and not technical in nature
- "When you look at an application, there's a huge ecosystem of roles supporting it."
- creative/productive
	- computing: systems administration, it, hardware
	- design: graphic, user experience, 
- managerial (processes, not people)
	- "Most people hear 'manager' and think 'bosses people around' but most management roles are about processes, not people.
	- project, product, program managers
- marketing, sales, etc

Education
- some! 
- productive roles: 
	- Computer Science & Engineering, Graphic Design, Illustration
	- different speciality programs 
	- related disciplines like physics, biology, chemistry
- managerial roles
	- business administration, business technology management
	- CS & engineering programs
	- various certifications PMA etc
- marketing, sales, etc
	- marketing, journalism, english, general arts etc.
- broadly speaking a degree beats a diploma beats high school. I am a proud college grad (Sheridan, in Oakville). Degree gets deeper theory, harder problems, better networking options but colleges offer more practical knowledge, easier to get up and running. 
- co-op programs are like 100x better than non co-op options. work experience is *huge* for fresh grads.

Job Opportunities
- fairly variable
- technical roles definitely in high demand *but* early career folk are considered very replacable, certain roles (game developer) are very exploitable. 2-3 years of experience kind of the sweet spot, thus co-op being awesome
- other roles are in demand but somewhat less reliably so. EG, over the past couple of years BlackBerry has gone through some layoffs which have most strongly affected the non-technical roles. Most of those people found new work fairly quickly, though.


Conclusion
- do some kind of wrap up.

- viewing and sorting resumes
	- I am not all interviewers
	- Recruitiers and HR bots look for keywords
	- I look for people who are interested in learning how to build apps
	- I look for people with evidence of curiosity - especially personal projects
	- I look for good cover letters.

## The Communitech Apps Factory
- what we do (super short)
- why we do it (slightly longer)
- how we do it (the crux?)

## Unsorted Script-ish Thoughts

I'm going to talk very briefly about what the Apps Factory does: Ultimately we build software and most of the people here have at least a broad sense of that, and many know more than I do. I don't want to get too deep into it because we've broken the application development process into specific services and it's not my intention to be all pitchy here.

Our target client is someone who has an idea for an application but does not have the technical knowledge or team to do it themselves. Our goal is to help them make progress towards that goal, primarily through education but also through explicit client services work.

We've broken it into two key phases: application design and development. 

First a quick definition of an application: An application is a computer-based system that accepts data, manipulates data, and presents the results of that manipulation.

Most of our clients have only a limited concept of what their application should be. They are people who have deep domain knowledge, having worked in some industry for years. They know their market, they know their customers, they have establish some process or system that can be automated and provide value to the user, either because they've been personally working with these users or because they themselves are a user.

So they know the domain, they know the system they want, but they don't know how to communicate these things. I call it the 'car stereo' problem. I hate my car stereo but if I were to go into a store somewhere to get a new one I'm pretty sure I'd talk to a commissioned sales person who would dazzle me with things and where I really want something that has a clock and an auxillary in for my ipod (and maybe a volume button) I'd walk out with one of these grotesque multi-function flashing light equalizer heavy doodads that takes me 5 minutes to get started every morning.

This is because I don't know a damn thing about car stereos and I feel guilty talking to people who are trying to sell me things and feel like I should just nod my head and take their advice. The more I participate in sales-related activities the more I realize that this is actually being a shitty customer for a service organization (probably not for a stereo sales organization) because I'm going to walk out of that encounter resenting how much I 
[@IMAGE: 20-sided die on a 1] spent, I'm going to resent this thing I don't use 95% of and don't care to use 95% of and I'm going to hate that stupid thing more and more every time I look at it.

This is exactly the kind of experience with application development I do not want my clients to have. With me or with whomever develops their final product, be it my team, an in-house development team, or one of the amazing development agencies in town. And the way I see to prevent that is 

We stole the name for our first service from the Real Estate industry. We call it Staging: We help present the idea in the best possible light. Simple, clean, compelling. You all know it as "wireframing". I hire a smart and experienced university student - most frequently from Systems Design Engineering, but if things went well at ranking time I'd also be grabbing someone getting her degree in Rhetoric - usually on their 4th or 5th work term to talk with our client, brainstorm, and put together a set of wireframes that captures the idea.

The second service is our Brokering Service, which is a bit of a misnomer. It's really an introductory service, and if I'm being completely honest it's really not a key focus for us, and as a result it suffers. The idea here

- rant a bit relating to each service?


## Script Attempt!
[decent picture of me]
I've included this picture mostly as evidence of my typically much less creepy face. 

I'm Rob. I'm the Apps Factory develoment manager, a title which, like most probably, doesn't entirely reflect what I do. I think "Grout" is probably a little better, in that really my role in the Apps Factory is to fill in the gaps. Maybe "Mortar" is nicer. Anyway, I was brought in to be the day-to-day grown up type in the Apps Factory.

[slide]
I'm going to talk today about a couple of things, mostly the process of developing applications and what I know about team development. To do so I'm going to wrap it all in the context of the Apps Factory, because that's really the lens through which I'm doing these things on a day to day basis.

[slide]
To get started, some background. The Apps Factory officially opened for business on Monday, May 2 2011. I was hired at Communitech on Monday, April 25 2011. It was a busy week.

[slide]
The idea of the Apps Factory started quite a bit earlier than that though. Last month Carol Leaman shared with us how she was the first EIR at Communitech, and arguably the Apps Factory story starts sometime back then. But I'm a big fan of exposition and rambling, so I'm going to go even further back, to 1997. Plus I really kind of love Communitech and love telling this story.

[slide]
In 1997, the tech community in Waterloo was quite a bit different than it was now. Some of the names we take for granted were still small companies and while the University of Waterloo has pretty much always had a great point of view when it comes to the commercialization of research, there wasn't a lot of support outside of that. 

[slide]
Many of the folks we might think of as luminaries now were just startup nerds, even if they were doing pretty well. They would meet once a month for dinner and trade stories, support, advice, successes, failures, all that good stuff. This started before 1997 but I don't know when. It was in 1997 that the idea to create an industry association specifically for the local technology sector was formalized, in the form of the Communitech Technology Association.

We weren't the first, Canada's Technology Triangle has been around advocating for the region since I think 1987, but they advocate for the region as a great place for all kinds of industry (which is true!) we at Communitech focus primarily on technology.

[slide]
Communitech's early years were pretty slow, in the way I tell the story (to be fair, I am a late comer by any reckoning). The most significant factor to me is the growth and development of the Peer2Peer network, which takes the basic model of getting people together on a regular basis to share with others doing similar work. Today there are somewhere around 30 such groups. They're deeply important to me as it was through the Peer2Peer network that I first discovered Communitech, sometime in 2005. 

[slide]
It was through the Peer2Peer network - the Watstart and Web Developers groups specifically - that I started engaging with Communitech. For several years I attended the regular meetings and started to get to know some people in the community. At the time there were some of the only regularly occuring events for geeks, and as a result I met lots of people, landed some nice freelance opportunities and built up the courage to leave a job I didn't like, strike out on my own and accumulate enough debt to keep my family paying it off for years. Sigh.

[slide]
It was also through those groups that I got a job at a small local web development copmany, and then a few years later when the posting for the Apps Factory Senior Developer position went public and I applied that I knew several people at Communitech already which made it a reasonably easy choice (I think) to hire me in.

[slide: "Communitech helps tech companies start grow and succeed"]
Historically, most tech companies were started by technical people who developed a product and then needed to learn how to make a business out of it. When Carol started as Communitech's first EIR, that was also the earliest days of what is now Communitech's Startup Services Group.

[slide]
The SSG is great at helping early stage technical companies understand markets, investors, high growth, product market fit, all that stuff. What they didn't do - and still mostly don't but they're growing as well - is have a good answer for non-technical people who already understand their markets, know what a product needs to be, but don't know anything about getting it built.

[slide]
One more factor. In the fall of 2010 a project out of the Velocity dorm at UW generated a bit of buzz. The 7 Cubed Project was a team of students who spent 7 days making 7 prototypes. They did (and still do, this is a great batch of people) some really interesting work. This is hearsay and conjecture based on what I remember of conversations that are now almost three years old, but in my opinion this was the last piece of the puzzle.

[slide: pieces coming together]
Communitech had long wanted to improve relations with the Universities. Students were coming into town, spending the better part of 4 years here and leaving. The Hub was opening during the fall of 2010 with a mandate to explore Digital Media projects. Communitech had to turn away people who didn't have technical resources. The Apps Factory was born.

[slide: "4 Developers, 4 Months, 4 Applications"]
The Apps Factory started by building prototypes for people. We'd send out a call for submissions, run the ideas through a selection committee and run the full project over the 16 weeks or so that each co-op term takes. We did this for the first year of the Apps Factory, which was run as a pilot project to test the assumptions.

[slide: "YES"]
Were co-op students a good development resource?

[slide: "YES"]
Was there demand for a service to build prototypes?

[slide: "NO"]
Was the call-for-submissions process effective?

[slide]
We learned a lot of things that year, and everything we learned became what the Apps Factory is today.

[slide]
The biggest change was to our intake cycle. The 8-month cycle from the first call for submissions to final project delivery was deeply impractical. People with ideas who can wait 8 months before they get a prototype are rare, and it significantly limited the field of possibilities for us. If a client dropped the project for any reason - extremely common when your primary audience is startups - we were left without enough work for the team. We changed to a standard, rolling intake.

[slide: "Finally  (small)er, this is not the conclusion"]
So. I promised to talk about our application development and team development and with that background out of the way, now I can do that.

[slide: "Well..."]
Almost. One quick disclaimer: The Apps Factory is a very unusual development shop, and as a result the way we do things is not universal. I'm inclined to argue that there is no universal way, but my intent is that this isn't a "here's how to do things" talk, but more of a "here's one way to do things, maybe that's helpful" talk. I'd also argue that's what all talks are anyway, but I like to be explicit.

[slide: "Write"]
The single most important part of the application process is to write things down. This does two things:
- makes you think about what you want the application to be
- allows you to communicate the idea

This can be anything. A document that you type into. We - the Apps Factory and I would argue the industry at large - like wireframes, which I'll get into a bit more soon.

[slide: "Share"]
Next, you need to tell people about your idea. This is a tricky prospect as a lot of people are concerned about intellectual property. It's okay to be, though in my very much not lawerly or business-smart opinion it is over-rated. Find people you can trust, sign an NDA (or http://friendda.org/). Even if you're working with other people, you need to talk about the idea with both impartial third parties and potential customers. The earlier this happens, the better feedback you get.

[slide: "Collect"]
After talking with a few people, you'll find that you had a lot of assumptions that weren't included in the document. These are largely easy to suss out, as you'll end up explaining them over and over again.


You'll also get a lot of feedback and advice. This is the harder stuff to deal with, as much of it is going to be bad but sound really really cool. People will often share these with identifiable phrases like "It would be really cool if..". The challenge here is to pull out the genuinely awesome nuggets, file away the potentially awesome nuggets for later consideration, and disregard completely basically everything else.

[slide: "Edit"]
The important thing to remember at this phase is to keep things small. Big Hairy Audacious Goals are good and probably super important, but those are an end point and at this point in the process we're beginning. Killing your darlings is just as important in application development as it is in writing.

And, uh, probably in public speaking but if we could all agree to ignore that fact I'd appreciate it.

[slide: "Write, Share, Collect, Edit."]
I think most of you in this room recognize this process, it's pretty standard and when talking with our clients they also recognize it as such. Any project anyone does begins with planning and figuring out the first steps in some fashion or another. Because application development is a huge unknown, people think they don't know anything but in reality this is a great how you start any project, especially creative ones.

[slide: storyboard/wireframe picture]
Like a lot of other types of projects, there are tools that help facilitate the process. I mentioned ours earlier: Wireframes. The development industry stole the concept of storyboarding from the entertainment industry and gave it our own name. There's lots of different types of wireframes

[slide: napkin drawing]
sketches

[slide: balsamiq drawing]
low fidelity

[slide: photoshop mockup]
high fidelity

[slide: balsamiq drawing again]
At the Apps Factory we focus on low fidelity mockups. We use a tool that I love called Balsamiq Mockups which is an application that contains a huge amount of templates of common interaction elements - buttons, text boxes, all those things. They are very explicitly derived from hand-drawn sketches because one of the challenges development shops have seen in the past is sharing high fidelity mockups which make an application seem far more complete than it really is. 

[slide: empty living room]
It's a lot like a Staged house. It looks like a real house, there's a couch there and a plant over there and it's so empty and beautiful and I could just move right in! 

[slide: our living room]
But then I bring in all the stuff I actually live with - and I'm totally blaming my kids for the clutter because that and eventually cutting the grass are what they're for, right? - and the reality of living in the house is quite different than the fantasy. That's true for a wireframe versus a complete application as well. As you begin building there are compromises, ideas for features that get thrown out or heavily changed. 

[slide: something representing a prototype]
For us, this is where prototyping comes in. A prototype is actually only relatively rarely helpful which was another big lesson from our first year. At that time we'd accept a project and pound out the specifications with the client and the first thing my co-ops would do when they started was the wireframes. Along the way we noticed, and some of the feedback we got supported this, that the wireframes themselves were almost as valuable to the client as the prototypes we delivered at the end.

[slide: value?]
This was really interesting to us, for several reasons. Just the wireframing stage of development is a relatively small amount of work, and it provides tremendous value to the idea sponsors. We reshuffled things a little bit, began dedicating one of our co-op positions to sudents with a focus on User Experience development and our Staging service has been the point of highest volume.

[slide: meeting]
Here's how we Stage applications: Once all the formalities are out of the way we schedule a kick-off meeting between the client and our UX Designer. They sit together for about an hour or so and talk about the application with a focus on who the users are and what goals those users are trying to achieve. We can incorporate existing documentation but my preference is for us to start from scratch, with no assumptions. A blank slate.

[slide: brainstorming]
Very little about the meeting is formal, and usually the only one taking notes is the UX Designer. After the meeting there's usually a day or two where the Designer brainstorms. The exact method of brainstorming changes from term-to-term as the different designers apply their own methodologies. Once they get a feel for the screens in the application they begin composing the wifeframe with Balsamiq.

[slide: formalization]
After the first draft is assembled another face-to-face meeting is scheduled. The client is sent the first draft so they have a chance to process and think of feedback, then we bring them in and the UX Designer go through it again.

[slide: red pen edits]
We expect a lot to be wrong at this point. The first draft, especially when someone else is compiling it, almost always is. We're adding a lot to an application at this stage based on what we know about existing applications, and our assumptions based on that one fairly simple conversation. Most of what we add is wrong, many assumptions that the client had didn't come out in the early conversation.

[slide: "we will be wrong"]
Being wrong is really important to me. Often times people will passively let bad or wrong information pass by but when you put something on paper and put it in front of them it is very difficult for them *not* to correct you. This process continues. Additional drafts often don't require in-person meetings. When the second draft is sent to the client it's often times almost entirely correct, and only a few tweaks to wording or layout are required. Most projects go through 4 iterations.

[slide: "Write Share Collect Edit"]
As you can see, we're encapsulating this first major step of the application development process. While I think the people I hire are awesome, it's rarely the case that we do things that a client couldn't but I do think we do it quicker, with fewer errors, and often times it's just easier to get someone else to do the grunt work while you sit back and edit.

[slide]
At the end of the process, we've done two things for our clients:
- made them think deeply about their application
- made them communicate the idea

And we've captured that second item in a way that is portable.

[slide]
Once you as the idea sponsor has those things, development can begin. They're super important though, even if you have an internal development team if you don't have a clear vision for what you want and can clearly communicate that vision, the chances of things going poorly are significantly increased.

[slide: Brokering]
The Apps Factory has services that can help with development. I'm going to spend most of my time with the Prototyping Service but I want to touch on Brokering quickly, because I've learned a little bit about choosing an outsourced development team. In this section I use the term "developer" a lot, and by this short-hand I really mean the development shop as a whole. 

[slide: Skill]
I wish it were otherwise because it would make the whole process easier, but the developer's skill and experience are the single most critical factor. We're lucky with the brokering service in that I can point to many examples of the skills of the companies we work with so I don't need to worry about this. 

[slide: Relationship]
My wish is that the relationship is the single most important thing, and assuming a minimum bar of ability is met I do argue that it's the strongest factor for hiring someone. A development shop can be brilliant and amazing but if you don't enjoy working with them, the process will still be painful. Your developer should be able to explain any constraints to you. Your developer should tell you when you've made a wrong decision and be able to explain why it's incorrect. 

[slide: "The Three Developer Trial"]
Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby, has a great blog post from 2010[1] on outsourcing which is still accurate. He talks a lot about paring down the idea, writing things down, things like that. It's fair to say this post influenced the way I do things at the Apps Factory, though I'm not sure how much I would have understood had I not gotten things wrong a few times first. Anyway, one point I didn't have to get wrong to understand is what I've been calling the three developer test. Figure out a really really small project. A decent choice is a simple web site, although that doesn't really test developer competence, so if you can wrap up an important but small feature of your application into one project that is the ideal. Send the project description to three development shops.

[slide: "Vanished\nLate\nAwesome"]
I like to say that one of those developers will disappear with your money, one will ship but really late, and one will be awesome. In practice, the split is probably not that clear but the real goal is to give a tiny project to test what it's like to work with the people involved. You spend more for this specific feature but far, far less than what you might if you talk to just one and make the wrong choice.

[slide: Prototype]
So, prototypes.

I build prototypes for two main reasons: 
1) To prove something is (or isn't) technically possible. Is a key feature of your application even possible on the platform you want?
2) Customer development. Does the problem you are addressing exist, and does your solution solve it for your features?

The first type is reasonably self-explanatory and typically is more a record of a developer's exploration of the system moreso than it is a usable application. It is ugly, has big buttons that perform certain tasks and either works or doesn't. Prototypes for customer development are a little more complex.

[slide: "Plan to Throw One Away"]
A prototype is going to be thrown away. It's an old adage amongst developers - first stated by Fred Brooks[2] - that the first version of any project gets thrown away, so you may as well plan on it. Brooks has since recanted as agile methodologies have increased in popularity, and while I generally agree with that recantation it's still the case that for our clients expecting the prototype to be thrown away is important. 

Being committed to a project is a different position than many of our clients are in. For an individual or small firm to significantly invest in an application it can be very much worthwhile to test assumptions with the expectation of being wrong, and that's where a prototype comes in. 

[slide: value cliff]
Prototypes have a value cliff. Because they're probably going to be thrown away entirely, or at least heavily rewritten, it doesn't make sense to include much beyond the most fundamental assumptions to be tested. It doesn't make sense to invest in heavy design and branding. A clean and simple application that does very little is the best use of your money.

Even if you're not building a prototype, having the first milestone be something you can show to really friendly potential customers to get their thoughts is going to result in a lot of changes for the better.

[slide: "!= MVP"]
Last slide on the topic, I want to emphasize that a prototype is *not* an MVP. This is not something you can put in front of end users. It doesn't solve the problem, not really. It presents one possible solution to the problem that is probably wrong.

[slide: Team!]
Okay, team stuff. I was hoping for a better segue into this but I couldn't cram it in. Once again I want to caution that the Apps Factory is a very atypical development team, and what works for us won't work for everyone. But every team is unique so there's probably very little advice that does.

[slide: af structure]
In brief, this is our preferred model for development teams. A manager, some number of sub-teams made up of two co-ops mentored by a senior, and one or more ux designers. Since our development teams are building prototypes, the ux design is largely complete before they get their hands on it, and the ux designer is answering specific questions or offering suggestions on how to tackle a problem. Most of their time is spent working on wireframes for our clients.

[slide: Turnover]
Other than myself, the only consistant member of my team is one of my senior developers. The other is part time, and new, and on a short-ish contract so while we're hopeful that will be extended right now it's a bit of an unknown. Until last year when Chris started, it was just me and the co-ops. This quite obviously leads to some serious team building constraints.

[slide: something about newbs]
Every four months, we get 3-6 new people who have no idea what kind of work they'll be doing, don't have a lot of experience in professional environments, don't know each other and most of the time don't have any experience with the technologies we'll be using. Our goal, as soon as possible, is for them to become friends with each other and confident enough in themselves to churn out large volumes of pretty decent quality product. I think we've largely been succesful.

[slide]
I was hired after the co-ops for the first term of the Apps Factory. I really got lucky. The team that was hired was a group of experienced developers, fairly late in their co-op careers with a solid breadth of experience. It made the first term, while we figured out just what the Apps Factory was, really really great. 

[slide]
I was involved in the hiring for the second term. I learned about Jobmine and Ranking Co-ops, I edited the job descriptions and interviewed a bunch of great candidates. I ranked my four 1s and a bunch of 2s and even a 3 I think. On matching day I was super excited to see which of these amazing folk would be coming in and... no one took the job.

[slide: some kind of rage comic]
Not a single fucking one.

[slide: "0 for 4"]
Okay.

[slide: "Loser"]
Well.

[slide: ]
I've discovered since, that isn't entirely uncommon. I made some pretty classic blunders in that I talked too much and focused on how awesome I thought Communitech was. I rejigged some of the descriptions, though not much since they really were doing the job of attracting candidates, I talked to a bunch of the people I know who were hiring students or had recently been hiring students, and I shuffled the way I did interviews. 

[slide]
Quite accidentally, as a result of going into continous rounds I hired a bunch of very early career candidates. The team turned out to be pretty good, with the exception of one who still ranks as the single worst hire ever. Brilliant, disgustingly brilliant, math student who did not give a fuck about programming applications. The following term I had some challenges hiring as well, but filled two of the positions before going into continuous rounds.

[slide: hire young]
In continous rounds I hired two students who were on their first work terms, one of whom is still one of the best programmers who has been through the apps factory. I discovered that by targetting students early in their co-op careers I was far, far more likely to get my offers accepted.

[slide: Hire the Curious] 
Just hiring early-stage kids isn't really a great way to build a team. I mean, you'll fill every slot but you still need to find some way to weed people out. Joel Spolsky famously described the best candidates as Smart and Gets Things Done and I'm generally in agreement with that but I also need people who can learn very fast (which is not entirely congruent with Smart) and people who are able to work on a team. I call these people Curious, which has a very intentional double meaning. They exhibit curiousity, and they themselves are often a little weird in some fashion or another.

[slide: The Numbers]
I get between 100 and 120 resumes every term, and filter that down to 12 candidates for the 2-5 open developer positions I have any given term. 12 because I do 30-minute interviews and spend an entire day doing it. I could squeeze one or more interview slot into a standard business day but I'm already moderately certain later candidates are at a disadvantage due to my melting brain. 

[slide: Selecting Candidates]
The broad process is for Chris and I to filter down the candidates to somewhere in the 20-ish neighbourhood. We use different processes for filtering and I'll be talking about mine, mostly because I've never really asked Chris what his is. Anyone we both like is on the list. Some terms we've had to go through the ones we both like to eliminate a few, other terms we've had to work through the ones that were only on one of our lists to fill up the 12. My hunch is that the former is more common, but we've only interviewed together 3 or 4 times so there's nothing statistically relevant.

[slide: Pass 1]
On my first pass I try to be inclusive. Really the only thing that gets you eliminated is a completely generic resume. If the only thing a candidate can tell me is that they take the same classes as everyone else and have worked on the same projects as everyone else, then I have to drop them. I hate it, quite a lot, because I guarantee you that I'm missing out on awesome people whose only fault is that they can't make a resume, but this process alone gets rid of close to 50% of candidates.

The past two terms I've taken to flagging the most stand-out resumes as "strong", and both times I could probably have set my interview schedule just from the results, but Pass 1 is a skim and part of what I'm looking for - somewhat in contradiction to the previous statement - are people who have potential but can't quite demonstrate it.

[slide: Pass 2]
I am more critical in pass 2. I look for a few key things, like a Github account, a web presence, an email address at a vanity domain. And most of all, personal projects and especially personal projects relating to mobile or web development. I eliminate a lot of people who I don't think would accept the job - either because we're doing much more simple development work than they've done in the past, or because their background has nothing to do with application development and there's nothing to indicate why they're switching. I'm definitely losing great candidates here as well, but I need people who are going to be challenged by what we do - which is maybe a weird statement that I hope makes sense soon.

[slide: Pass 3]
This is where I usually have to get down to brass tacks. By this point I'm usually down to 25-30 resumes, probably all of whom would do well at the position. I really start to focus on the traits I want. The core is that personal project piece. I want people who are interested in learning the tools and technologies we work with and are starting to do so on their own. I don't care if they've done web junk or mobile junk or things like that, but someone whose personal projects are only deep, complicated RPGs or experiments in moderately complex mathematical operations like Rubik's cube solvers, probably is not going to enjoy learning how to develop a web application. And that's the key thing for me.

[slide: Will enjoy learning how to build a web application]
We do a lot of mobile work too, but the people who want to learn how to build a web application are just as happy to build a mobile application because they just care about building applications. The people who want to learn how to build mobile applications are generally also interested in web apps, but a lot of them really only want to learn mobile development, and I can't promise that.

[slide: Interviews]
What I'm looking for at the Interview is two-fold: Technical ability and team fit.

[slide: FizzBuzz - full question]
This is FizzBuzz. It's probably the most famous programming test question, there are entire web sites dedicated to answers in any number of languages. Most of the people I talk to rip through it with no problem but at least 1 of the 12 candidates get it horribly wrong every time. I don't need perfection, but I really do need someone who can make a for loop.

[slide: Team fit]
There's no specific personality type that we're looking for, and we really try to take into consideration the pressures of an interview, but if the candidate isn't asking questions. What both Chris and I try to do is get people talking about something they've built. Ideally a personal project but something for school or a previous co-op position is also good. What I'm looking for is for someone to get excited about what they've built, and be able to freely talk about what went wrong, compromises they had to make, things they're especially proud of, all of that. When someone is engaged they're able to get past the interview nerves and it's the best insight in this relatively poor process about what they're like.

[slide: warp tube]
All this other stuff goes out the window if they can pull out a demo of something they've worked on. We'll skip the test and a lot of the other questions to see something they've built.

[slide: no assholes]
I hate phrases like "rockstar", "ninja", "guru". I feel like this is a general rule, but for this position especially, there's really no place for egos and people who self-identify as such are more likely to have an ego. Great developers - and in my case those who have the potential to be great - need to be comfortable making mistakes and sharing their mistakes. 

[slide] 
For me, filtering for a UX Designer candidate is a much easier process. If the resume isn't usable, it's gone. That's it. One chance. This typically reduces the field of 30 or so applicants to 8 candidates. I try to get it down to 4. My UX candidates don't need to have a great deal of direct experience, but unlike the developers they do need to have 3-4 co-op terms completed and they need to be able to demonstrate that they recognize the hiring process as a system like any other, and they need to demonstrate that they understand the users - me and Chris - and make a usable experience. 

[slide]
Interviewing UX Designer candidates is harder, because there isn't the focus on current skills and there isn't the test. We probably play this one a lot more by ear but always bias in favour of people who can show off their work.

[slide: The First Week]
Team building is an on-going process, but the bulk of it happens during the first week, and there's a few things I do.

[slide: welcome email]
A week before the team starts I send an email with information on how to get to the Hub, what bus stops have worked well for students in the past and let them know I'll be buying them lunch the first day. The tone is intentionally casual, I share that I'm wearing jeans and a t-shirt and a hoodie - in the three years I've been doing this I've never had to edit that sentence - and I ask them to show up at 10. 

[slide: the first day]
The first day kind of sucks. I'm still working on it. I wipe all the computers before a new team starts and have them set up the development tools they'll be using over the course of the day. I talk about relevant policies. I make sure to swear early on in the day, I let people know that I'm going to buy a beer at lunch and - assuming they're of age which is only the case about 50% of the time - they are welcome to as well. Chris and I banter and he insults me once or twice. Not intentionally, that's just the way he is. Then I send them home around 4 o'clock or so.

[slide: comfort]
This is all done to let them know that they have control over their computers, that I'm not perfect and that I don't expect perfection from them. 

[slide: the first week]
Over the course of the first week we work on what is usually a fun little throwaway application. The goal with this is three-fold:
- they learn the tools and technologies and patterns of the apps factory
- they learn to work together
- they ship something by the end of the week

I think that shared success of shipping something together is perhaps the single most important thing that happens for them to gel as a team. They learn they can rely on each other and more importantly, that the others can rely on them.

[slide: discomfort]
This is usually a horrible and great week for them. Learning all the pieces of a web application in the space of a few days is hard, and most of them may have played with jquery and html a little bit, but I'm throwing them face-first into technologies like nodejs, mongodb, backbonejs, tools like git, deployment to heroku and half a dozen other smaller things.

I usually send them home around 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon.

[slide: the second week]
Client work begins the second week. They've had a success, they've had some exposure to our technology stack, now it's time for real work. I don't actually expect a lot of shipped work during this week, and I tell them that. The goal isn't to make a new application it's to continue learning in the context of the application. 70% of what they do during this week is reading stackoverflow and tutorials and learning the structure of whatever they're building but by the end of it they're much, much more comfortable.

[slide: lunch]
Over the course of the term we do several team lunches, paid for by Communitech. They are more frequent towards the start of each term, in large part to get everyone interacting away from the desk. They're also more frequent towards the end of each term as we use up the budget and celebrate launches.

[slide: campfire]
We use a tool called campfire for general chatter and link sharing. I consider it very important for a team to have a community space for stupid cat pictures, awesome t-shirts, ridiculous kickstarter projects and every now and then, work-related information. Campfire's a solid tool, but there's a few different options. It's not at all uncommon for a conversation to begin on campfire and break out into the real world, and I really try hard to participate in those conversations. First and foremost because they're fun and interesting, but also because when you see your boss tossing out ideas on how to rig up a bean bag chair to detect who is in it and whether or not they have great productivity as measured by github commits it is much much easier to jump in and participate yourself.

[slide: standups]
We are a very loosely scrum-based shop but the one unbreakable rule is standup. We do standup when we're all in, or at 9:30 whichever comes first. Everyone talks. Last summer we had a business development intern, and she participated. People on different projects talk and share. "Strict" is not something we do well, but it typically is over in 5 minutes, occasionally 10 and when we - by which I mean "I" - start to babble Chris cuts it short and over time most students are able to as well. 

[slide: equality]
Chris is the best developer on the team. I have the most experience. But we both fuck up All The Time and I think that's one of the most important things we do to build the team. We're more experienced but we're not necessarily smarter and without everyone on the team working we'd never be able to pull off what they do. My theory is that this is the single best motivator and I do everything I can to make everyone feel like they belong just as much as whomever is beside them. When everyone is asking questions of everyone else, I know that the team has gelled.

[slide: responsibility]
Team building and the development process sort of come together here. I think for all programmers, ownership is a critical motivating factor. Not like, equity ownership, but responsibility ownership. Their voice should be heard. The best way to reach this point is to clearly define your expectations - I'm still really poor at this - and let them figure out how to get there.

[slide]
So. I think that's it.

[slide: Write blah blah blah slide]
The most important step in application development is figuring out what you want, and sharing that with others.

[slide: Prototypes are for customer development]
Show a horrible but early version of your application to friendly potential customers and get feedback on it.

[slide: Three Developer whatever rule thing]
Assuming a minimum bar of competence, the relationship is the most important thing. Test for both early in the process.

[slide: Hire the Curious]
Look for people who want to learn.

[slide: Make sure they're comfortable]
Do things to make your team comfortable. For me it's wearing hoodies and swearing, buying food and encouraging chatter.

[slide: Make sure they're challenged and victorious]
The first week sucks, but getting through it is a huge win.

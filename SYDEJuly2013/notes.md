OUTLINE
- Me, briefly
- Apps Factory, what we do briefly
- Apps Factory, how we work, somewhat less briefly

- Methodologies are a formal way to describe what needs to be built and to track where in the building process a project is.
- Predictive: Define everything up front, figure out how long it will take, do it.
	- Pros: Expectations clearly set on all sides. Timelines, budgets, resource needs understood.
	- Cons: Rigid, don't allow for changing requirements. Estimating sucks and everyone sucks at it. Unknown complications are commonplace.
- Adaptive: Figure it out as it happens.
	- Pros: Figure out what is most important *now*. Priorities change as requirements change. 
	- Cons: Unexplored dependancies can result in fragile systems. Timeline ($$) can be very unpredictable.

"Agile" is an umbrella term for adaptive methodolgies, defined in 2001 (http://agilemanifesto.org/) but around long before then.

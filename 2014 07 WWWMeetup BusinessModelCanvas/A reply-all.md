A reply-all [*cough*]storm happened overnight (and is still going on). All the [Recent Acquisition] folks were added to a distribution list for dogfooding a [Major Line of Business] product (because that's what we do around here, orgs get added to email distribution lists cuz you're supposed to help test new products) and a few emails got sent out, then a bunch of people who aren't used to being on dogfood distribution lists started replying-all with "REMOVE ME" and then a bunch of long-timer-[Employees]-who-should-know-better replied-all with "STOP REPLYING ALL" and then people actually replied with "+1" to the "STOP REPLYING ALL" emails and then some [Recent Acquisition] folks had ^the gall^ to reply-all with "Perhaps if we all chime in something will be done! REPLY ALL!!!!" which is like throwing a stinky-tofu-bomb into a Denny's.

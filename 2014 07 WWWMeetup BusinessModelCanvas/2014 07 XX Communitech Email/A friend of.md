A friend of mine in San Francisco was talking about a very poor ramen festival, and it made me think: Where locally is the best place to get ramen?

I have a moderately well structued pho-erarchy for the region but I am pretty sure that other than Mr. Noodle I have never paid for ramen. Where should I begin correcting this egregious oversight?

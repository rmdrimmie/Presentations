Business Model Canvas

[image of canvas]
The BMC is a tool for creating business models. It's a big sheet with 9 cells, each of which has a specific purpose.

So, that's nice and all, but why?

"a startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model"

This was four and a half years ago, and in my day-to-day at Communitech and as an observer of international startup culture, the business model canvas is the core tool around which all business development occurs. 

[but I'm not a startup/ batman slapping robin]
Outside of startups it isn't hugely popular, but it will be.

[science!]
The business model canvas is the scientific method applied to business development. It provides a framework around which hypotheses are created and tested and observations are recorded.

Geoffrey Moore is possibly most famous for his book Crossing the Chasm. In 2011 his most recent book

provides large enterprises - think GE, IBM, etc - a framework around which to create internal business units patterned after startups to continually drive innovation into the large organization.

[Business Model Canvas]
So, this tool is the core way that new businesses and new lines of businesses are being discovered. 

And to clarify, not just for tech either. The industry is somewhat secondary to this. This has repeatedly been used for education, hospitality, health, manufacturing, whatever. Any industry where there's a product or service being developed.

[Customer Segments]
Who is the product or service for? 

This can be several groups of people - very similar to personas. When identifying different segments, think about what makes them different, including the need for different relationships or distribution channels and especially whether or not the different segments you've identified would pay for different aspects of the product. If not, they might not be different segments.

After identifying some segments, you can decide which to target, maybe it's all maybe it is none but it's these segments around which the rest of the model is created. 

[Value Propositions]
Why are each of your segments going to give you money?

[Channels]
Where do we talk to our customer segments? Which ones work, and which ones work best?

[Customer Relationships]
What is the nature of the relation we have with each segment? Are we acquiring, retaining, upselling? What do they expect from us and are we doing it? 

You can see in mine that I am pretty clueless about that when it comes from the meetup. We're ultimately a community and that's the most important relationship we have with all of our segments but we do still want to grow all three segments. 

[Revenue Streams]
What are customers willing to pay, and how do they pay it?

This is where this experiment revealed something interesting to me that really shouldn't have been a revelation. Maybe the Attendees and Speakers aren't my customer? If you don't pay, you're the product. 

Hello, my inventory!

[Key Resources]
What do you need to pull off the value proposition? If people are going to pay you for brand awareness or as a recruiting effort or to give back, what do you need to support that?

I didn't actually add "organizers" on until an edit phase of the content here but honestly that's probably the core resource these kind of community events.

[Key Activities]
If you don't do these things, your business model dies on the vine. If you are microsoft and you don't do software development, your business dies. If you are McCabe's and you don't sell food and drink, your business dies. What do you need to do to prevent your business from dieing.

[Key Partnerships]
Who do we rely on for resources and activities? 

For us our venues are probably the most important partners. We need places we can rely upon to have good food and drink, good environments, and with whom we can establish long term relationships. 

Members of the community - those here and the broader tech community in KW/Cambridge/Guelph - who advocate for us. People like Julia who still has a strong network, and Dan who we can rely upon for content.

This is a giant unknown for me, which is kind of a big red flag, too. Here's a really, really obvious place to start focusing some thought and effort.

[Cost Structure]
Doing basically anything resembling a business costs money. It's important to know those costs, which ones change over time and with scale and how those changes occur.

[Full Canvas]
And that's a full Business Model Canvas, version 1. 

Now that it is filled in I have a whole collection of things I think to be true, but I don't yet have any data about that. The next step is to create a hypothesis about each of these items - some of them are already there like "the value proposition for sponsors is recruiting". 

I hypothesize that recruiting isn't very high on the list of reasons any of our sponsors have given us money but I could be wrong about that. The only way to find out is to actually ask them. 

Which is the next step. Every hypothesis created by every entry on the canvas needs to be tested. 

The next step isn't to create 20 or whatever hypothoses now, but to go back through the canvas starting with Customer Segments, create some hypotheses and test them. When we learn for example that yes, we are creating value for attendees but we are not creating value for sponsors, well that is going to ripple out through the rest of the canvas. These blocks are all connected to each other and every single one is an opportunity to learn more about what we're trying to do and how we are or are not doing it right.

As we test hypotheses and update the canvas we get closer and closer to a successful business model. Ideally the canvas model doesn't become invalid, we just change what we were doing to better focus on reality. Sometimes it's a drastic pivot, sometimes it's small improvements.

Title: Before you talk to a developer.
Audience: Business owners who want an application developed.

What is NOT covered: 
- Whether or not you *should* develop an application
- Technical choices - stack doesn’t matter.

Thesis: The most important factor to a successful relationship with a developer is trust.

Goal: Describe how to establish trust. 

1) Legal documentation. This is a business transaction. Ensure that both sides are covered equitably. Most business owners exploring applications have held the short end of the stick, but so have most developers. If everything goes wrong, are you covered? Are they? A fair contract protects both sides.

2) Trust is established when both sides understand the destination. Document what you want. 

3) Trust requires visibility. Expect and ask for regular (weekly is typically good) updates. Expect that the early ones especially will be really ugly and not functional. Expect not to be able to do a lot with the application until you are 60-80 percent of the way through the project cycle. 

4) Communicate. Frequently. If you feel like you are in the dark, let the other party know. If you feel like things are going in the wrong direction, let the other party know. If there is something that is making you uncomfortable or unhappy, let the other party know. These are all common, and not necessarily indicators of a bad project *but* do not let red flags or concerns go unaddressed they will only grow over time.

5) Test. After documenting the project pull out a small piece, something that can be built for 2-5k and give it to three developers. It is an additional expense, but it creates the confidence you need. Be up front about what you are doing. Ask for their help in identifying an appropriate test. 

The Story:
This presentation is 

- work we do at the apps factory
- success story or two
- some of the how to steps

What we do at the apps factory *is* the how to steps, so similar to my geek girls dinner I’m going to talk about the process in the context of the apps factory.



Introduction:
- introduce self, talk briefly about the apps factory.
Good morning. Thank you so much for having me.

My name is Rob Drimmie. I am a developer, and for the past three years I’ve been managing a program Communitech called the Apps Factory. 

Communitech is a not-for-profit organization in Waterlo with the mandate to help tech companies Start, Grow and Succeed. 

Through the Apps Factory, I work almost exclusively with people who are exploring an idea they have had for an application. In general, these people are non-technical and have never been part of a development project, so most of what I do is guide and educate people through the early steps of the development process with the hopes that they part ways with us with the knowledge they need to be comfortable and successful.

And that is all I am going to say about the Apps Factory. If you have any questions about it specifically I love talking about it but really want I want to do is spend my time on our process and how you can follow it with or without us.

An important assumption about the content here is that you are looking to outsource the project to a typical client services development agency.
